    <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="pills-fruit" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-fruit-tab">A wide variety of fruit is grown and available in Australia. There is plenty of choice throughout the year.  Choosing fruits in season provides better value and better quality.  Eating seasonally also adds more variety to your diet throughout the year.  And just like with veggies, choosing different coloured fruits increases the variety of nutrients, which can enhance your health! </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-grain" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-grain-tab">Grain foods are mostly made from wheat, oats, rice, rye, barley, millet, quinoa and corn.  The different grains can be cooked and eaten whole, ground into flour to make a variety of cereal foods like bread, pasta and noodles, or made into ready-to-eat breakfast cereals.</div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-meat" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-meat-tab">Traditionally, the foods from this food group are considered ‘protein rich’ and most Australians have no trouble eating enough protein each day.  More importantly however, this food group also provides a wide variety of other nutrients such as: iodine, iron, zinc, vitamins, especially B12, and essential fatty acids. </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-milk" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-milk-tab">A wide range of milk and yoghurt products are available with varying levels of fat.  Milk can be fresh, dried, evaporated, or UHT (long life). Cheese is usually high in kilojoules, saturated fat and salt and is best limited to 2-3 times a week. However, some cheeses also have reduced levels of fat and salt. </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-vegetables" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-vegetables-tab">There are many different types of vegetables grown and made available in Australia with a large variety of choice throughout the year.  Vegetables come from many different parts of the plant, including the leaves, roots, tubers, flowers, stems, seeds and shoots. </div>
